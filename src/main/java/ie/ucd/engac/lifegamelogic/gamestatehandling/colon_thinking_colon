Got it. Each tile reports an list<enums> that I can use to generically parse the required
 actions for it - do we have a list of all states? Don't think so at present.
That way I get to know use as generic as possible code.

list of enums or list of states (I prefer enums)





Also andrew does the eval_tile functionality exist yet? Do you actually increment through
 a board graph, or do you just arbitrarily assign a tile that we landed on?
What I mean by that is does that need to be made.
