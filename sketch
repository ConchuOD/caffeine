game class - container for all the different items that need to be drawn
each game object that need to be draw lies in here
each object will draw itself
objects:
    players
    UI
    decks?
    board
contains the game logic, probably as a sub class
contains a queue which has each of the events added by the UI
runs in a while loop w/ sample flow:
    gameupdate:
        do  items in queue
        sets any potential flags
    gamedraw:
        loops through list of items & calls their draw function to load into buffer
        may alter based on flags set
    gamerender:
        switches buffered image onto the screen
    @end of while loop
JFrame/JPanel (need to find out which, probably panel as only drawing this when in game) is passed to the objects in their constructors so they know where they are to draw themselves
Need to invent a coord system, or is it provided?
