run() only called when board is active
board only has to be drawn once?
get board info into "memory" before the game JPanel is made visible
each loop call update in a thread which activates the dequeing etc
lock user out of HUD unless they are required to use it
after a while, a la that lad, draw the new stuff.
if specified game update function has not yet returned then draw the old state
buttons need to queue events, but deactivate themselves somehow when they do for a certain period of time
this time depends on the function carried out by the button :/
